## COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS & FIXES

### Problem Summary
The home page had 50+ text color instances that were either pure white (`text-white`) or very light gray (`text-gray-300`, `text-gray-400/80`, `text-gray-500`, `text-gray-600`) making them invisible or barely readable in light mode while working in dark mode.

### Solution Strategy
Implemented dual-mode color support using Tailwind's `dark:` modifier:
- **Light Mode:** Dark gray/charcoal colors for readability on light backgrounds
- **Dark Mode:** Maintain original light colors for readability on dark backgrounds
